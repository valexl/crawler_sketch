IDEAS
  INDUSTRIES FOR URL
    1) Meta-tags
    2) Try to get infromation from SSL certificate (probably description... I am not sure that there are many web sites which contains this information in description)
    3) http://www.seobythesea.com/2012/07/google-categories-web-pages/
    4) https://github.com/alexandru/stuff-classifier
    5) We can start with this inustries http://hbswk.hbs.edu/industries/ or https://biz.yahoo.com/ic/ind_index_alpha.html. Then we try to find this industries in some metatags and start learning our machine. 



1) We have to create available industries list
  2) We have to have implements for detecting new industries (for the first time we can use some constant list. For example http://hbswk.hbs.edu/industries/)
  3) We have to have implements for detecting industry for the current page
    3.1 Try to find words from industry in title or page description field
    3.2 Try to use machine learning for detecting industry by title or description
    3.3 If the industry is nil then mark this url as unprocessable at the moment
    3.4 After some time this url will be run again by this algorithm (when machine learn increase its knowledge)

1) what will you do
2) when is it ready
3) how much does it cost?

input: url
output: industry
